<h2>About</h2>
I'm a recent graduate from the Georgia Institute of Technology, where I received a BS in Computer Science. My primary research interests are in computer vision and machine learning. I have worked at the Computational Perception Laboratory in James Rehg's group, as well as the Mobile Vision team at Google (hosted by Menglong Zhu).
