<h2>About</h2>
I'm a recent graduate from the Georgia Institute of Technology, where I received a BS in Computer Science. My primary research interests are in computer vision and machine learning. I have worked at the Computational Perception Laboratory in James Rehg's group, as well as the Mobile Vision team at Google (hosted by Menglong Zhu). I've been heavily involved in many projects related to video understanding, including video object detection, scene flow estimation, and action recognition.

Mobile Video Object Detection
<br>
<img id="detection" src="detection_viz.png">
In this work, we provide a natural way to combine SSD detectors and LSTMs into a single unified network. Using the very fast Mobilenet-SSD architecture and our modified, highly efficient LSTM networks, we perform object detection in real time on low-powered mobile devices. See our <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1711.076368">paper</a> and demo video.

Stereo Scene Flow Estimation
<br>
<img id="sceneflow" src="sceneflow_viz.png">
In this upcoming work, we combine deep learning and optimization techniques to propose a novel algorithm for fast and accurate stereo scene flow estimation. More details and demo video will be up shortly.
